    "## Weighted Massey System\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook runs the Massey method but allows you to add certain weights to each game. You can choose the weights for home wins, away wins, neutral wins, and based on when in the season the game occurred. This code differs from the order dependent Massey by having one teamâ€™s win against another always mean the same thing, aside from differences based on chosen weights. If you think that teams are more or less the same at the beginning and end of the season, this is a good notebook for you.\n",
